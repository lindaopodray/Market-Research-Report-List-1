<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poultry Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The poultry isolator market comprises two primary types: positive pressure isolators and negative pressure isolators. Positive pressure isolators maintain higher internal air pressure to prevent contaminants from entering, ensuring a sterile environment for sensitive poultry. They are ideal for disease prevention and biosecurity. Conversely, negative pressure isolators create lower internal pressure, allowing harmful particles to be drawn out, offering protection for both poultry and workers. Each type plays a critical role in improving health standards and biosecurity in poultry farming.</p></p>
