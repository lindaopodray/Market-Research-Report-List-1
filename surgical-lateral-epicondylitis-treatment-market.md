<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Lateral Epicondylitis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arthroscopic Surgery</li><li>Open Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical treatment market for lateral epicondylitis consists of two main types: arthroscopic and open surgery. Arthroscopic surgery involves minimally invasive techniques, utilizing small incisions and a camera to guide the procedure, leading to quicker recovery and less postoperative pain. In contrast, open surgery entails a larger incision to directly access and repair the affected tissue, offering a more traditional approach but often resulting in longer recovery times. Both methods aim to alleviate pain and restore function to the elbow.</p></p>
