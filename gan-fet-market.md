<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GaN FET Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Depletion Mode</li><li>Enhancement Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The GaN FET market is categorized into two primary types: depletion mode and enhancement mode. Depletion mode GaN FETs are normally-on devices, which means they conduct current without an applied gate voltage, making them suitable for applications requiring quick switching. In contrast, enhancement mode GaN FETs are normally-off devices, only conducting when a positive gate voltage is applied. This characteristic allows for safer operation in power electronics, driving their demand in sectors like renewable energy, automotive, and telecommunications.</p></p>
