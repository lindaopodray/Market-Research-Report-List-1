<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for CNS Disorders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) disorders primarily involves two approaches: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo therapy entails extracting cells from the patient, modifying them genetically in a laboratory setting, and then reintroducing them into the body, targeting specific CNS issues. In contrast, in vivo therapy involves delivering genetic material directly into the patient's body, typically through viral vectors, to induce changes in the CNS without prior cell extraction. Both strategies aim to correct genetic abnormalities and restore normal function.</p></p>
